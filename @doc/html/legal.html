        <p>This MERCHANT AGREEMENT is made between YOU (hereinafter "You", "Your", "Yours", and/or "Merchant") and TWT2PAY, INC. (hereinafter "TWT2PAY") with respect to Your use of TWT2PAY's payment processing services (hereinafter the "Agreement"). Your receipt of payment processing services from TWT2PAY shall be governed by and shall be subject to each of the below terms and conditions. Accordingly it is important for You to carefully read the below terms and conditions.</p>
        
<div class="legal_title">1. Your TWT2PAY Account.</div>
<p>By submitting a Merchant Application and agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, You hereby authorize TWT2PAY to establish a TWT2PAY Account for You (hereinafter Your "Account"). You hereby understand and acknowledge that Your use of Your Account shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. TWT2PAY shall in no way be obligated to open an Account for You and reserves the right to refuse to provide the processing services set forth in this Agreement to any individual, business, and/or other business, for any reason.</p>

<div class="legal_title">2. Application and Underwriting.</div>
<p>You will be asked to fill out and submit an application on the TWT2PAY website (hereinafter the "Website") in order to receive a TWT2PAY merchant account (hereinafter "Merchant Application"). You will be asked to provide Your contact information, including name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, in addition to Your Social Security Number. TWT2PAY may also request that You provide proof of Your identity and a voided check for the account into which funds will be settled pursuant to this Agreement. You hereby represent and warrant that all of the information contained in Merchant Application is true and accurate. You further authorize TWT2PAY to investigate the information contained in Your Merchant Application and to utilize credit reporting agencies and any other source reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of any information that You have provided to TWT2PAY. You further authorize the credit reporting agencies to release any information that they may have regarding You or Your business to TWT2PAY. As part of the underwriting process, TWT2PAY may request that You provide additional information. Your failure to timely provide TWT2PAY with the additional information requested may result in the immediate rejection of Your Merchant Application. TWT2PAY will typically notify You of the status of Your Merchant Application within one (1) business day of it being submitted. Circumstances may arise which require additional time to consider and review Your Merchant Application, in which case, TWT2PAY will notify You of the revised timeline.</p>


<div class="legal_title">3. Your User Name and Password.</div>
<p>If Your Merchant Application is approved, You will receive an TWT2PAY Account. You will be provided with a unique user name and password which can be used to log on to the gateway portal provided by TWT2PAY for the purpose of accessing data and information related to transactions settled in Your Account, the fees charged under this Agreement, and your Account profile (hereinafter the "Merchant Portal"). You may utilize the temporary user name and password which TWT2PAY provides You with, or after logging into the Merchant Portal, You may choose a new user name and password. You are to protect the integrity of Your user name and password and shall not disseminate Your user name or password to any individual who is not directly authorized by TWT2PAY to access data and information related to transaction settled in Your Account.</p>

<div class="legal_title">4. Services.</div>
<p>TWT2PAY will provide you with payment processing services to facilitate Your acceptance of any valid credit or debit card identified herein (hereinafter the "Services"). You must have an existing ability to process transactions online. TWT2PAY does not provide you with physical Card terminals, shopping carts, or virtual terminals. The Services are only designed for processing transactions completed by Your customers online. If You do not have the necessary online presence or means to process credit or debit card transactions online, TWT2PAY will refer You to a provider of that service.</p>

<div class="legal_title">5. Card Acceptance.</div>
<p>You will honor any valid credit or debit card (hereinafter the "Card" or "Cards") properly tendered for use that falls within Your designated categories of acceptance, check each Card for validity and currency, and examine one or more Card security features before completing a Card transaction. When accepting any Card and completing any Card transaction, You must follow all procedures and rules set forth in, or incorporated by reference into, this Agreement, including but not limited to, obtaining authorization for all sales transactions from the holder of the Card (hereinafter "Cardholder"). In the event TWT2PAY, for whatever reason, is unable to obtain, or due to system delays chooses not to wait to obtain, authorization from its Bank, who is unable to obtain or chooses not to wait to obtain authorization from an Association, TWT2PAY may at its option "stand-in" for such entities and authorize the sales transaction based on criteria established by TWT2PAY, and You shall remain responsible for such sales transaction as if it was actually settled in accordance with this Agreement. Any authorization obtained by You shall be noted by You in the appropriate place on the sales transaction. All sales transactions and credit vouchers will be on forms acceptable to TWT2PAY or in a format approved by TWT2PAY in writing, and will be completed to include the Cardholder's signature, the signature of the authorized user (if different), the date, a description of the merchandise sold or services rendered, and the total charges therefor. At least one copy of the sales transaction receipt or credit voucher will be electronically delivered to the Cardholder. All sales transactions that You deliver to TWT2PAY will represent the obligations of a Cardholder in amounts set forth therein for merchandise sold or services rendered only and shall not involve any element of credit for any other purpose.</p>

<div class="legal_title">6. Card Sales.</div>
<p>You shall only complete and deliver to TWT2PAY sales transactions produced as the direct result of bona fide sales made by You to Cardholders and for only those products and/or services identified by You, for TWT2PAY's, in connection with Your Merchant Application. You shall obtain T<br>

WT2PAY's prior written approval before accepting Cards for the purchase of products and/or services not identified on Your Merchant Application. You are expressly prohibited from processing, factoring, laundering, offering and/or presenting to Bank sales transactions which are produced as a result of sales made by any person or entity other than Yourself.</p>

<div class="legal_title">7. Account Servicing Documents.</div>
